# Express Mongoose App

A RESTful API for managing clothing items and users, built with Express.js and MongoDB.

## Description

This project is a backend API that provides endpoints for managing a clothing item database. Users can create accounts, add clothing items with weather-specific categories, and interact with items through likes and dislikes. The application follows RESTful principles and implements proper error handling and validation.

## Functionality

This API provides endpoints for managing users and clothing items. You can interact with these endpoints using HTTP requests through tools like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or any other API testing tool.

### Features

- **Weather-based categorization**: Items can be categorized as "hot", "warm", or "cold"
- **User ownership**: Each clothing item is associated with a user
- **Like system**: Users can like/unlike clothing items
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
- **Error handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Centralized routing**: Clean route organization with centralized error handling

## Technologies and Techniques Used

### Backend Framework

- **Express.js** - Web application framework for Node.js
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **RESTful API Development** - Standardized API design principles

### Database & Data Management

- **MongoDB** - NoSQL document database
- **Mongoose** - MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **Database Schema Design** - Structured data modeling with relationships
- **Data Validation & Sanitization** - Input validation and security measures

### Security & Best Practices

- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive data validation using Validator.js
- **Error Handling** - Secure error responses without exposing sensitive information
- **HTTP Status Codes** - Proper RESTful status code implementation
- **Request/Response Middleware** - Custom middleware for request processing

### Development Tools & Quality Assurance

- **ESLint** - Code linting with Airbnb configuration for code quality
- **Prettier** - Automated code formatting for consistency
- **Nodemon** - Development server with hot reload for efficient development
- **Git Version Control** - Source code management and collaboration

### Software Architecture & Design Patterns

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern** - Separation of concerns architecture
- **RESTful API Design** - Standard HTTP methods and resource-based URLs
- **Middleware Pattern** - Request processing pipeline architecture
- **Centralized Routing** - Single point of route management for scalability
- **Modular Architecture** - Separated concerns with reusable components

### Code Quality & Organization

- **Modular Structure** - Organized codebase with clear separation of routes, controllers, and models
- **Environment Configuration** - Configurable database connections and settings
- **Status Code Constants** - Centralized HTTP status codes for maintainability
- **Generic Error Messages** - Security-focused error responses
- **Clean Code Principles** - Readable, maintainable, and well-documented code
- **API Documentation** - Comprehensive endpoint documentation

### Performance & Scalability

- **Asynchronous Programming** - Non-blocking I/O operations with async/await
- **Database Query Optimization** - Efficient MongoDB queries and indexing
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Error Handling

The API implements comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid input data
- **404 Not Found** - Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server-side errors

All error responses use generic messages to maintain security and provide consistent user experience.
